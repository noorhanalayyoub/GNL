# Descriptioin
The **get_next_line** project is part of the 42 Network curriculum.  
The goal of this project is to implement a function that reads from a file descriptor and returns a single line each time it is called.
A “line” is defined as a sequence of characters ending with a newline character (`\n`) or the end of the file (EOF).  
The function must handle reading from files, standard input, and other file descriptors efficiently and safely.
This project is designed to strengthen understanding of:
- File descriptors
- Static variables
- Dynamic memory allocation
- Buffer management
- Reading data incrementally
- Avoiding memory leaks
# Instructions 
make -> compile into .o files  
make clean -> delete .o files 
make fclean -> delete .o files and libftprintf.a
make re -> rebuild everything 
# Resources 
- manual for read , open , close 
- linux file descriptors overview
