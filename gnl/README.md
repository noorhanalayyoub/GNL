# Descriptioin
The **get_next_line** project is part of the 42 Network curriculum.  
The goal of this project is to implement a function that reads from a file descriptor and returns a single line each time it is called.
A “line” is defined as a sequence of characters ending with a newline character (`\n`) or the end of the file (EOF).  
The function must handle reading from files, standard input, and other file descriptors efficiently and safely.
This project is designed to strengthen understanding of:
- File descriptors
- Static variables
- Dynamic memory allocation
- Buffer management
- Reading data incrementally
- Avoiding memory leaks
# Instructions 
- include "get_next_line.h" in your functions 
- compile with : cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror *.c 
- you can change BUFFER-SIZE using -D flag at compilation  
# Resources 
- manual for read , open , close 
- linux file descriptors overview  
- geeksforgeeks
